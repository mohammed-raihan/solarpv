In this work, a detailed methodology has been presented for the performance
evaluation of a solar PV powered vaccine refrigerator for remote locations. Thermal
modelling with hourly cooling load calculations and the refrigeration cycle simulations
were carried out. The performance parameters for three environment-friendly
refrigerants; R152a, R1234yf, and R1234ze(E) has been compared against the
commonly used R134a for two remote locations.
