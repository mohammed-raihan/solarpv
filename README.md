In many remote localities, one of the underlying reasons for not receiving life-saving
vaccines is the lack of electricity to store the vaccines in the required refrigerated
conditions. Solar Photovoltaic (PV) refrigerators have been considered as a viable and
green solution to store the vaccines in remote localities having no access to electricity.
In this paper, a detailed methodology has been presented for the performance
evaluation of a solar PV powered vaccine refrigerator for remote locations. Thermal
modelling with hourly cooling load calculations and the refrigeration cycle simulations
were carried out. The performance parameters for three environment-friendly
refrigerants; R152a, R1234yf, and R1234ze(E) has been compared against the
commonly used R134a for two remote, off-grid locations in Bangladesh and South
Sudan. The energy systems comprising of solar PV panels and batteries to run the
refrigerator were modelled in HOMER software for techno-economic optimizations. For
both the locations, R152a was found to be the best performing refrigerant exhibiting
higher COP (2% - 5.29%) as compared to the other refrigerants throughout the year.
The energy system providing electricity to the refrigerator with R152a also had lower
levelized cost of electricity (0.48% - 2.54%) than the systems having other refrigerants
in these locations.
